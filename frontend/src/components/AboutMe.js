      I'm a recent Computer Science graduate from Carleton University, based in
      Ottawa, ON. With a solid foundation in web development technologies
      including JavaScript, HTML, CSS, Node.js, and React, I am keen to
      transition my academic knowledge into practical applications. Although I'm
      at the early stages of my professional journey, my portfolio demonstrates
      a strong capability for problem-solving and developing efficient software
      solutions. Actively seeking roles in frontend, backend, and full-stack
      development, I aspire to join a team where innovation, collaboration, and
      making a tangible impact through technology are at the forefront. I'm
      excited about the opportunity to grow as a full-stack developer and
      contribute my skills to create meaningful projects. Let's connect!
